# RWHEC-Tabb-AhmadYousef2017
Methods for robot-world, hand-eye calibration; version 1.1 using OpenCV 3.0, &lt;3.0.

June 1, 2018: This code is now deprecated in favor of a new, modern version at https://github.com/amy-tabb/RWHEC-Tabb-AhmadYousef.  However, we keep this version available in case those with older versions of OpenCV prefer it.

A bug with regards to the computation of the translation error has been corrected.

This README covers instructions for building the code.

This code uses the Ceres, OpenCV (3.0, though instructions for 2.4 are given as well), and newmat libraries.  Ceres uses cmake, so as a result, this is a cmake project.  You will need to have cmake installed in order to build the project.
Ceres link: http://ceres-solver.org/
	We are not responsible for whatever it takes to get Ceres to build; but advise that having a recent version of Eigen and Google's glog are helpful to the process. 
OpenCV link: http://opencv.org/
	To use OpenCV > 3.0, no alteration is needed.
	To use OpenCV 2.4.9, go to the CMakeLists.txt file in the code_src folder, this line:
		target_link_libraries(RWHEC_release_Jul2016_Project ${CERES_LIBRARIES} newmat opencv_core opencv_highgui opencv_imgproc opencv_calib3d opencv_imgcodecs)
	Remove "opencv_imgcodecs" and the code should link.
Newmat link: http://www.robertnz.net/nm_intro.htm  We use the newmat11 beta version. Instructions for building are here: http://www.robertnz.net/nm11.htm#starting . 

This code has been tested on Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04.  You are welcome to convert it to Windows, but we have not.  Also, note than while OpenCV and newmat are avaliable through the repositories, we download and build these libraries from the latest versions.

Building:
These instructions assume that you use cmake to generate a project file for the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  There are other methods for using cmake to generate an executable.  You are welcome to use them.  These instructions are provided to give the basics assuming you have an Eclipse installation.

1. The code is provided in a directory called "code_src", along with a CMakeLists.txt file.  Place and/or rename "code_src" in a location of your choosing. 

2. Create a directory.  I'll call mine "build". 

3. Then cd to the build directory: from bash -- cd build.

4. Then, copy the following string to the base command line: cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT=TRUE path_to_src
(where you replace "path_to_src" with the path to where you put the code_src folder.)

5. Then, go to the Eclipse IDE, CDT (C development toolkit). Go to File->Import->Existing projects into workspace. Select the project in the "build" directory.  This will load the project into Eclipse.  Build from Eclipse, and you're ready to run.


Running:

1. The executable using the method above is going to be in the build folder.  The arguments for the program are:

	A. input directory -- this is where the images and robot positions are held.

	B. write directory -- this is where all of the results will be written to file, including transformation.

	C. Optional flag, 0 or 1.  If the flag is 0, do only camera calibration.  If the flag is 1, do robot world-hand eye calibration using a previously-computed camera calibration. 
 If no flag is specified, do camera calibration and robot-world, hand-eye calibration.  Most users will want to not specify a flag.

Instructions for the input format can be found in: README_input_format.txt.

Run time:
It will take some time (on the order of 4 minutes) to perform camera calibration, and then to perform all of the robot-world, hand-eye calibration methods (4 minutes more), though this varies by dataset and image size. 

INPUT FORMAT -- DATASETS ARE POSTED AT THE National Agriculture Library's Ag Data Commons, DOI is 10.15482/USDA.ADC/1340592

Access the datasets via link here: http://dx.doi.org/10.15482/USDA.ADC

Required Directories:

images

internal_images

Each of these directories, should contain directories by camera with images.  For instance, for one camera, the "images" directory should contain "camera0".  For two cameras, it should contain "camera0"" and "camera1." Use the provided datasets as templates for how to set up your own datasets.

The "images" directory represents the images for each stop of the robot.  "internal_images" contains extra images that are used for camera calibration only.  The directory structure of "camera0", "camera1", etc. within "internal_images" should be used, if "internal_images" is present.

Required files:
calibration_object.txt : This file gives the specification of the calibration pattern.  The units can be changed, and the particular strings used 'chess_mm_height', 'chess_mm_width' are not used by the program.  However, the ORDER of the parameters matters.  So make sure the use of units is consistent, and do not switch the height and width ordering within the file.
	Example from dataset 1:

	chess_mm_height 28.5

	chess_mm_width 28.5

	chess_height 6

	chess_width 8

robot_cali.txt : This file gives the number of robot positions, as well as the rotation and translation parameters for the robot.  In the notation of our paper, these matrices are B_i.  Note that our definition is the inverse of some other works.  

Optional Included file:
ExperimentDetails.txt : This file gives some parameters of the experiments for the provided datasets and is not required to run the code.


OUTPUT FORMAT
This README file is to accompany code for robot-world, hand-eye calibration, produced by Amy Tabb and Khalil M. Ahmad Yousef as a companion to their paper:
	Solving the Robot-World Hand-Eye(s) Calibration Problem with Iterative Methods, which is currently under review.

If you use this code in project that results in a publication, please cite the paper above.  Otherwise, there are no restrictions in your use of this code.  However, no guarantees are expressed or implied.

This README covers the output format generated in the write directory, and how to interpret that format.

Camera calibration:

For each camera, a directory will be generated with the name "camera_results*" in the write directory, including:

	1. For each image that the calibration pattern could be found, an undistorted version of that image.

	2. cali.txt, a file with the calibration information for each image	

	3. details.txt, a human-readable file with the internal and external camera calibration information.

	4. program_readable_details.txt, a file that saves the results of camera calibration to be loaded later by the program for robot-world, hand-eye calibration, if it is desired to perform these in two stages.

Robot-world, hand-multiple-eye calibration:

A. For each method, a directory will be generated with the short name of the method in the write directory. To correspond directories to the methods in the paper, look at the code in the switch statement (copied below).  "rwhe_E_c1_simul" is an abbreviated form of "robot-world, hand-eye calibration using Euler parameterization of rotation components, c1 cost function, simultaneous version."  Each directory contains the following:

	1.  A directory for each camera, with the location of the camera as computed by the robot-world, hand-eye calibration method detailed in cali.txt.
	2. details.txt, a log of the progress of the method, including the output from Ceres.

	3. reproj*_*.png, for each image where the calibration pattern was found, the difference between the reprojected world points of the calibration, as computed using the robot-world, hand-eye calibration X and Z and the original image points is represented with a blue line. In the terminology of our paper, the two points are x_ij-tilde-arrow in Equation 13, and x_ij-arrow.  The sum of the squared line distances for all images in shown in Eq. 14.

	4. transformations.txt, gives the X and Z matrices for the robot-world, hand-eye calibration method.  If there was more than one camera, there will be more than one Z matrix. 
	
	Note** if you are using one of the methods that also refines the camera calibration parameters, you will have to read that from the "details" file. 
	For instance, these are camera calibration parameters (in vector format), followed by the transformation matrices, for the three-camera case:

B. Besides the directories for each method, there will be a directory titled "reconstructions".  This has .ply files for the calibration pattern reconstructed using the calibration information from each method, including the ground truth (ideal.ply), and is sometimes useful for visualization purposes.  These model files can be viewed in a viewer such as MeshLab.

C. comparisons.txt, shows the results according to the metrics we discuss in our paper, excepting the reconstruction accuracy metric.

D. reconstruction_accuracy_error_comparisons.txt, shows the individual results for the reconstruction accuracy metric.
